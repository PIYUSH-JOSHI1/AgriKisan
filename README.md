# Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

## Project Overview
This project provides an AI-powered tool designed to help small and medium-scale farmers make informed decisions about water management, crop health, and irrigation needs. By integrating Earth Observation (EO) data with IoT sensors, the system delivers real-time insights and predictive analytics for optimized farm productivity.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collects and displays real-time data from IoT sensors (soil moisture, temperature).
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses AI to predict water stress and irrigation needs based on historical and real-time data.
- **Localized Insights**: Provides hyper-localized recommendations tailored to the specific region and crop.
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use mobile app with offline capabilities for remote areas.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Integrates local weather data to assist in future planning and decision-making.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Native (for mobile app)
- **AI Models**: TensorFlow for predictive analytics
- **IoT**: ESP32/Arduino for real-time sensor data collection
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud/AWS for data hosting and real-time processing
- **Database**: Firebase for real-time database and cloud storage
